/**
 * Per-company query scoping helpers.
 *
 * Background
 * ----------
 * SAM provisions one database per (connection, app) pair. Multiple
 * Opera companies (single-letter `company_code` like 'C', 'I', 'Z')
 * live inside that single database and must be discriminated by a
 * `company_code` column on every per-company table.
 *
 * Visible (user-driven) read paths receive the active company via the
 * `X-Opera-Company` header, which SAM injects on every request from
 * the portal iframe and which middleware (see app-context.ts) attaches
 * to `req.operaCompany`.
 *
 * Invisible (webhook / cron / background) read paths have no request
 * context. Each must resolve the company before any query — typically
 * by looking up an identifier from the inbound payload (mandate_id,
 * subscription_id, organization_id) in our own per-company tables.
 *
 * Either way, every read MUST end up scoped by `company_code`. The
 * helpers in this file enforce that — and fail loudly when a code path
 * forgets to thread the company through.
 *
 * Design
 * ------
 * The earlier ad-hoc pattern (returning `{}` when company is empty so
 * unit-test fixtures keep working) is a cross-company leak waiting to
 * happen — Knex spreads `{}` into `.where()` and the query becomes
 * an unfiltered scan. The first row Knex emits wins, and it's almost
 * certainly the wrong company's.
 *
 * `companyScope(code)` therefore THROWS on empty/missing input. Real
 * code that legitimately operates across companies (admin tooling,
 * data migrations) must use `unscopedDanger()` — explicit, grep-able,
 * impossible to call by accident.
 *
 * Test fixtures must use `companyScopeForTesting()` — also explicit,
 * also grep-able, so production code can never accidentally fall
 * through into the no-filter case.
